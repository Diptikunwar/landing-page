I’ve been exploring how real landing pages are actually designed, and this project was a good reminder that good UI isn’t about adding more sections — it’s about guiding the user toward one clear action.

This landing page was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on:
clarity over clutter,
structure over decoration,
and intent-driven design over random components.

The goal was simple: create a standalone page that feels purposeful, responsive, and usable — including a light/dark mode and a basic lead capture flow.

Projects like this help me think beyond “how it looks” and more about how users move through a page.

Still learning, still refining.
Would love to hear thoughts or suggestions.
